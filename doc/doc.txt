OsEID - MyEID differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OsEID tries to support all features which are available in commercial card
<<MyEID>>.  Thanks to that, no special software/drivers is needed for
commonly used operating systems.  For Windows, Linux and Mac OS opensource
project <<OpenSC>> can be used as driver for OsEID card.

OsEID disadvantages to MyEID card (mechanical)

- no SIM version of card
- mechanical construction - big, not compact as one plastic card

OsEID disadvantages to MyEID card applet version 4.X:

(These functionalities are not supported by MyEID driver in OpenSC up to
0.18, perhaps OsEID will support these functions in future)

- RSA - only value 65537 is allowed as public exponent
- experimental support for symmetric encrypt/decrypt - DES and AES
- experimental support for key unwrap
- experimental support for key wrap
- experimental challenge response PIN
- experimental Admin state and Global unblocker state
- no PIV/CIV emulation
- no Auto size files (only auto size DF)
- no 224 bit NIST curve
- no support for automatic delete of session objects
  (please read MyEID 2.3.0 referene manual)
- slow RSA
- slow ECC

- MyEID applet version 4.5.X allow use RSA keys up to 4096 bits, OsEID
  maximum is 2048 bits for RSA, and there is no way to run RSA with longer
  keys in this hardware.

experimental = feature is supported by OsEID card, but original MyEID card
function can work differently.  There is no enough information in MyEID
applet reference manual 2.1.4/2/2.3.0 and no OpenSC implementation to test
all functions.

OsEID disadvantages to MyEID card, applet version below 3.5:

(MyEID in version below 3.5 does not support EC cryptography)

- slow RSA

For a comparison, here is table showing the execution time of RSA decrypt
operation (time in seconds) for MyEID (3.3.3), OsEID (with exponent blinding
turned on):

|OsEID token (blinding on)| 1.2 | 1.4 |  2.3 |  5.5 | 10.6
|=========================================================

Times in this table are higher then times given in Features section, because
here the time of all operations that OpenSC runs on card, e.g.  card
identification, reading PKCS#15 files, reading public key.

MyEID card seems to be slower in filesystem operations, listing all card
objects by *pkcs15-tool -D* command run in 2.8 second for 5 RSA keys on card.
OsEID runs the same command, the same set of keys in 1.9 second.

Time depends on card reader too.  Both cards allow the same communication speed -
161290 bits/s for 5MHz readers, for tests 3.7MHz reader was used (about
120kbit/s).

- ECC speed is comparable to MyEID

|OsEID token              | 0.7   | 1.4    | 1.3   |  2.0
|========================================================

(there is no support for secp384r1 and secp521r1 in MyEID 4.0.1 card)


OsEID benefits to MyEID card:

- secp256k1 curve
- open source - can be reprogrammed for different usage
- for people who don't trust commercial solutions because of backdoors
- for people who are happy to make a card by themselves
- card and reader simulation (without real card/reader)
- AES192 (MyEID reference manual 2.1.4 documents only AES128 and AES256)

Making OsEID card
-----------------

Mechanical construction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Card components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Card is a composition of two components. First component is ATmega 128
microcontroller or ATmega 128A microcontroller.

image:images/atmega128A_small.png[Atmega128A]

ATmega 128A microcontroller is available with a number of vendors.  You can
buy ATMEGA128A-AU in TQFP64 package from http://www.farnell.com by sale code
1773397 (about 5E / Sep 30 2019).  Alternatively you can buy ATMEGA128A-AU from
https://www.tme.eu/en/details/atmega128a-au/8-bit-avr-family/microchip-atmel/
(price about 6E / Sep 30 2019).

The second component is single sided printed circuit board (PCB) in the form of plastic
payment card.

image:images/pcb_scan.png[PCB]

This board is designed to match card dimensions and card contact pads positions
defined by ISO 7816-1.  PCB also connects microcontroller leads to card
contact pads.  There is no vendor for this PCB, but you can produce this PCB at
your local PCB producer.  Your producer needs gerber file or PDF file or
simple image as a manufacturing data for PCB production.  Please check
download section for these files.  Thickness of PCB must be about 0.8mm to
meet dimensions of card recommended by ISO 7816-1. Picture of PCB is also
included in <<appendixA,appendix A>>.

Soldering microcontroller to PCB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PCB and microcontroller together form final smartcard. The components are
connected by soldering.  ATmega128A microcontroller is available in TQFP or
QFN/MLF package.  Thickness of QFN/MLF packages is in range 0.8 to 1mm but
soldering this package in amateur condition is very difficult.  Because of
soldering difficulty TQFP package was preferred.

Unfortunately, ATmega128A microcontroller in TQFP64 package thickness is
slightly below 1.2mm precisely in range 0.95 to 1.05mm + lead thickness
about 0.05 to 0.15mm.

If we solder TQFP package directly on PCB board, we can achieve thickness
slightly below 2mm.  That is not good.  To get minimal thickness of card,
microcontroller is imbedded into printed circuit board.  In the position of
microcontroller there is a rectangular hole created in PCB with dimensions about 15.3x15.3mm.
The body of microcontroller is inserted into this hole.  Then
microcontroller leads are slightly bent upwards and soldered to PCB copper
contacts from opposite side as normally.  This mounting can achieve final
thickness of card about 1.1mm.  Most of card readers deal with this
thickness without problems.

NOTE: Be aware that final thickness about 1.1mm violates ISO7816-1
specification, which defines thickness of card to 0.76mm with tolerance
+0.08mm.

PCB dimensions must also match ISO 7816-1 specification: width 85.47mm -
85.72mm and height 53.92mm - 54.03mm, and corner radiuses in range 2.88 to
3.48mm.

It is assumed that you have plenty of mechanical skills and experience with
soldering surface mounted integrated circuit. Further details
of the mechanical installation are therefore not listed here.
 
image:images/imbedding.png[Imbedding TQFP package into PCB]

PCB plating / coating
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For amateur use, a common printed circuit board without special surface finish will be sufficient.  
Because copper on PCB corrodes on air, sooner or
later, problems arise when using the card.  If you plan to use the card
frequently, it is advisable to use circuit board with gold-plated contact
pads.  An alternative to gold plating is silver plating or nickel plating. 
Consult your local printed circuit board producer what plating he offers and
at what price.

<<<

Programming microcontroller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before using the card, microprocessor must be programmed with card operation
system.  You need hex file _card.hex_ that is available in download section. 
To load hex file into ATmega128 microcontroller, you need Microchip/Atmel
programmer tool with programmer software.  For example, free software can be
found at http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/.  Programmer hardware overview can
be found at http://www.ladyada.net/learn/avr/programmers.html.  You can
learn more about programming AVR microcontrollers on internet, a good
website to start is
https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-trinket/programming-with-avrdude.

At this point the familiarity with programming AVR
microcontrollers through ISP is assumed. Your card already includes ISP connector but in
different format as normal Microchip/Atmel ISP6 or ISP10 connectors. Mapping
microcontroller pins to card contact pads and to standard Microchip/Atmel ISP6 can be
found in the table below.

.Mapping card / microcontroller / ISP contacts
[width="80%",options="header"]
|===========================================
| CPU pin name|ISO pad name| Atmel ISP name
| GND         |  GND  C5   |  GND    6     
| Vcc         |  Vcc  C1   |  VCC    2     
| RESET       |  Vpp  C6   |  RESET  5     
| PE0/PDI 2   |  RST  C2   |  MOSI   4     
| PE1/PDO     |  CLK  C3   |  MISO   1     
| PB1/SCK     |  I/O  C7   |  SCK    3     
|===========================================

It is recommended to make simple adapter from AVR ISP6 connector to CARD
contact pads.  You need a smart card connector and a ribbon cable with
IDC connector with 6 pins. Alternatively, if your programmer already
contains ribbon cable with 6 pin female IDC connector, you need 6 pin male
IDC connector.

image::images/adapter1.jpg[programming adapter]

You can buy it from here:
 
http://www.tme.eu/en/details/116b-dboa-r/card-connectors/attend/116b-dbo0-r02/
http://www.tme.eu/en/details/fc06150-s/ribbon-cables-with-idc-connectors/amphenol/
http://www.tme.eu/en/details/09185066324/idc-connectors/harting/

Carefully connect the cable to the relevant contact pads of smart card
connector.  Connect this adapter to AVR programmer, insert new card into
smart card connector and you can upload firmware into your card.

It is recommended to program microcontroller fuses first:

Extended fuses:  0xFF +
High fuses:      0xD9 +
Low fuses:       0x04 +

Then upload card.hex and at last step is programming lock bits:

Lock bits:       0xFC +

Example for *avrdude* and *avrispmkII* programmer:

----
$ avrdude -p m128 -c avrispmkII -v -U efuse:w:0xFF:m
$ avrdude -p m128 -c avrispmkII -v -U hfuse:w:0xD9:m
$ avrdude -p m128 -c avrispmkII -v -U lfuse:w:0x04:m
$ avrdude -p m128 -c avrispmkII -v -U flash:w:download/OsEID_card.hex
$ avrdude -p m128 -c avrispmkII -v -U eeprom:w:download/OsEID_card_eeprom.hex
$ avrdude -p m128 -c avrispmkII -v -U lock:w:0xFC:m
----

Your card is ready for use now.

Compiling from sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use source files to build card.hex.  Development is tested on DEBIAN
9.1.  You need *gcc-avr*, *binutils-avr*, *avr-libc*, *make*, *srecord* and
*avrdude* package.  You need to unpack OsEID tarball.  Makefiles located in *src* subdirectory
are used to compile and program the card.  Card serial number
is automatically generated from actual time/date.

----
make -f Makefile.atmega128
make -f Makefile.atmega128 fuses
make -f Makefile.atmega128 program
make -f Makefile.atmega128 lock
----


Vpp pad
~~~~~~~

In year 2006, the standard ISO 7816 changed the definition of *Vpp* pad. 
This pad is no longer used for programming voltage.  If you use newer reader
(produced after 2006), card may work, or fail in this reader.  If your OsEID
card does not working in your card reader, Vpp pad of card pad must be isolated
from reader.  This can be done by stick self-adhesive tape on Vpp pad.

Building OsEID-token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only partial information here, schematics, PCB and list of components is in
Appendix D.  It is assumed that only a skilled technician will try to
build this device.

<<<

Using OsEID card
-----------------

For linux users: download and install *OpenSC* package.  Please use OpenSC
version 0.19 or newer.  Debian (buster) already contains the *OpenSC*
version 0.19.  For other distros, please follow distro specific installation
of OpenSC package.  Download and install *pcscd* and *pcsc-tools* package. 
According to your card reader, you will need to install specific driver for
your reader (for example *libccid* or *libacr38u* package, ..  )

Windows users: download and install OpenSC 0.17.  (version 0.18,0.19 is only
partially tested, please read comments about minidriver configuration below)


Base functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fastest way to test the functionality of the card is by launching program 
*pcsc_scan* :

....

Press CTRL-C break *pcsc_scan* and you can go to configure *OpenSC* package.

<<<
Opensc package configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your OpenSC version is 0.20.0 or above, OsEID card is automatically
recognized. For older versions you need do some changes in configuration.

Configure OpenSC package: edit */etc/opensc/opensc.conf*

or if you use windows *C:\Program Files\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\opensc.conf* 

add new <<ATR>> for OsEID card and OsEID token in *app default* section:

----
        # OsEID card is handled by myeid driver
        card_atr 3b:f5:00:00:02:10:80:4f:73:45:49:44 {
		atrmask = "ff:ff:00:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff";
                driver = "myeid";
        }
        # OsEID token, T0/T1 protocol
        card_atr 3b:f5:00:00:02:80:01:4f:73:45:49:44:00 {
                atrmask = "ff:ff:00:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:00"
                driver = "myeid";
        }
----

If your OpenSC version is 0.20 or newer, and your using OsEID card with
firmware 20190102 or older, you need one more configuration directive in
*/etc/opensc/opensc.conf* in *app default* section:

----
        reader_driver pcsc {
                max_recv_size = 255;
        }
----

It is recommended that you install oseid profile files into OpenSC profile
directory (usually /usr/share/opensc/). Profile files for different versions
of OpenSC can be found in download directory.

After this configuration step, you can use *opensc-explorer*, *pkcs15-init*,
*pkcs15-tool*, *pkcs11-tool* and other software to personalize your OsEID card.


Windows minidriver configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you plan to use OsEID card in Win 10 (for example in EDGE browser etc.) you
need install *OpenSC* package (0.17).

Opensc version 0.17.0 functionality with OsEID card has been tested in WIN
10 (both 64 and 32 bit versions).  *certutil* command is fully functional
and TLS client auth in *EDGE* browser is working.  Opensc 0.18.0 and 0.19 fails
in EDGE, there is missing PIN dialog.

To use OsEID card, You need configure OpenSC package (add OsEID ATR to
opensc.conf file) and you need update your registry file.  Please use
OsEID.reg file from download section.

----
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Calais\SmartCards\OsEID]

----

Opensc from version 0.18.0 uses different location of file
opensc-minidriver.dll.  Please correct this in your register file:

----
"80000001"="C:\Program Files\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\minidriver\opensc-minidriver.dll"
----

For 32 bit OpenSC version on 64 bit system:
----
"80000001"="C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\minidriver\opensc-minidriver.dll"
----


After personalizing your card, you need to use *certutil -scinfo* command in
windows command prompt to import certificates from card into windows
certificate store. After successful import of certificates, you can browse
personal certificates by *certmgr* and/or *certlm* command.


Explore files on card:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On linux/windows with installed OpenSC package You can use *opensc-explorer*
to browse files on Your new card:

....
$ opensc-explorer 
OpenSC Explorer version 0.14.0

FAQ
---

What is OsEID ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OsEID is smart card with cryptography support, realized in amateur
conditions.  It consist of one integrated circuit (microcontroller
Microchip/Atmel ATmega 128) and PCB (printed circuit board).  No more
components are needed.

What can OsEID handle ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OsEID smart card supports both RSA cryptography and Elliptic curve
cryptography.  DES and AES ciphers are supported too.  It is (partially *)
compatible with ISO 7816 specifications.  Card support PKCS15 structure, RSA
up to 2048 bits and NIST elliptic curves (192,256,384 and 521 bits).

It is designed to emulate Aventra MyEID card in universal microcontroller.
No special driver is needed for use in Linux/Windows.

What difference is between MyEID and OsEID card?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OsEID is hobby/amateur smart card, MyEID is professional card.  OsEID come
with open source firmware in well known, easily accessible and inexpensive
microcontroller. 

Where do I buy a card ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The card can not be bought, You have to make it. (Read documentation chapter
Making OsEID card)

Where can I find the latest firmware version ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New versions are published on  https://sourceforge.net/projects/oseid
This is a primary site, code is available in tarball (all sources, firmware
files compiled from sources in HEX format, and PDF version of doc).

Same site can be reached at https://oseid.sourceforge.io

OsEID is also awailable on github - https://github.com/popovec/oseid

OsEID development track all changes in OpenSC MyEID driver.  All changes in
OpenSC thats affect correct functions of OsEID card are examined and a
update is uploaded into https://github.com/popovec/oseid. You usually need
these updates only if you use development versions of OpenSC.

HTTP online doc is available on https://popovec.github.io/OsEID


In what application I can use this smart card ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* openssh - private rsa key can be stored on card
* Firefox - secure login into web pages
* windows Edge - secure login into web pages (tested with opensc 0.17)
* Thunderbird - sign and decrypt emails
* openvpn - secure login to openvpn server
* easy-rsa - sign certificates by private key on card

Why RSA calculation is so slow?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ATmega128 is 8 bit CPU and runs at  low frequency (about 13.5MHz).
The chip has only 8x8 bit multiplier, no special acceleration units for
RSA and ECC, as it is in the world of commercial cards.

Is there a faster alternative to OsEID card?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, you can make OsEID token, but it is more complicated to make it. 
A lot of skill with soldering of SMD components is needed. The token is about two
times faster than OsEID card.  Token can run 2048 RSA operation in about
10.5 seconds.  Overclocked version can run 2048 bit RSA operation in about 7 sec.

Why OsEID is denoted as BETA software?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OsEID card software is in extensive development.  New features are added,
and lot of old code is optimized.  Lot of internal interfaces are changed
from version to version.  Finally, card behavior is tested using (partial)
regression tests.  Through this, nobody can guarantee the flawless function
of such a large system.  It is advisable to leave the BETA tag (for now) on
this project.

I found a bug in OsEID card, where can I report it ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can contact me (author) by email <popovec.peter@gmail.com>

Card communication protocol
---------------------------

Application uses formatted data blocks to communicate with card. This data
blocks are APDUs - Application Protocol Data Units.

APDU is constructed as block of bytes. There exists two types of APDU,
command and response.


Command APDU consist of four bytes and optional fields *Lc*, *DATA* and *Le*

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,8,1",width="85%"]
|========================================
|CLA  | INS  | P1  | P2  | Lc | DATA | Le
|========================================


Response APDU consist of optional response body and two status bytes:

[cols="8,1,1",width="85%"]
|===================================
| RDATA | SW1 | SW2
|===================================


There exist four formats of command APDU:

1. No command body, no response body
2. No command body, response
3. Command body, no response
4. Command body, response body

Short APDU allow maximal length of DATA field 255 bytes, extended APDU allow
maximal lento of DATA field up to 65535 bytes.

ISO7816-3 defines numbers *Nc* and *Ne* that corresponds to fields *Lc* and
*Le*. If *Nc* is 0, *Lc* field is not present, *Nc* in range 1..65535
corresponds to *Lc* in same range. Similar mapping from *Ne* to *Le* exist,
but *Ne* is in range 0..65536.

*Nc* value represent length of *DATA* field, *Ne* represent maximal length
of response body (below).  *Lc*/*Le* is coded in zero, one, two or three
bytes, coding depends on APDU case:


*CASE 1*: *Nc* = 0, *Ne* = 0, *Lc*,*DATA*,*Le* not present in APDU,
           APDU length = 4

*CASE 2*: *Nc* = 0, *Ne* > 0, *Le* present in APDU, APDU length = 5 or 7

  - (S) one byte in range 1..255 -> *Le* in range 1.255
  - (S) one byte 0 -> *Le* = 256
  - (E) one byte 0 and two bytes (big endian) *Le* 1..65536
        (value 0 represent 65536 bytes for *Le*)

*CASE 3*: *Nc* > 0, *Ne* = 0, *Lc*, and *DATA* present in APDU

  - (S) one byte in range 1..255 -> *Lc* in range 1.255, APDU length 5+*Lc*
  - (E) one byte 0 and two bytes (big endian) *Lc* 1..65535, APDU length 7+*Lc*

*CASE 4*: *Nc* > 0, *Ne* > 0, *Lc*,*DATA*,*Le* present in APDU

  - (S) one byte in range 1..255 as *Lc*, DATA (*Lc* bytes), one byte *Le*
        in range 0..255, represent maximum response length (0=256 bytes).
        APDU length = 6+*Lc*
  - (E) one byte 0, two bytes *Lc*, DATA (*Lc* bytes max 65535, 0 is not
        allowed value here), two bytes, *Le* (value 0 represent 65536 bytes
        of response) APDU length = 9+*Lc*


Here (S)/(E) is used to mark Short or Extended variant of APDU.


Application access card over card reader, card reader uses communication
protocol to transport APDU from application to card and from card.  This low
level transport uses Transport Protocol Data Unit - TPDU.

APDU is mapped into TPDU, but mapping depends on card communication
protocols.  OsEID card uses T0 protocol.  T0 protocol is byte oriented
protocol.  OsEID token can use T0 or T1 protocol.


APDU mapping to T0 protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Card is always waiting for 5 bytes (header):

[width="45%"]
|================================
|CLA  | INS  | P1  | P2  | P3
|================================

*CLA*, *INS*, *P1*,*P2* and *P3* bytes are transmitted to card.  *P3* byte
is used to inform card about optional command body or requested size of
returned data.  What exactly *P3* represent (command body or response
length) is determined from *INS* byte.

Header is transmitted, then reader is waiting for procedure byte from card.
If this procedure byte is not received until some time, card reader reject
card as unresponsive.

How procedure byte is processing is described in ISO7816-3/10.3.3 table 11.
If procedure byte is 0x60 (NULL), card reader only extend working time and
is waiting for new procedure byte.  This is used by card to inform card
reader that more time is needed for processing message.  This prevent
rejecting card as unresponsive.

If 0x6X or 0x9X is received as procedure byte, this is handled as SW1
(status word), then whole status word (and next byte SW2) is returned to
application.

If card reader receives INS (or INS negated, but this in not used in OsEID),
card reader send rest of APDU to card (or receives data from card). Another
values in procedure byte are not allowed.

From ISO7816-3/10.3.1: It is assumed that the card and the interface device
know a priori the direction of transfer... How this can be fulfilled ?

From reader view (only short cases of APDU):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*CASE 1* (APDU length 4 bytes) - no *Lc*, no *Le*.  (Nc = 0, Ne = 0).
Because header length is 5 bytes, P3 byte is set to 00.  Header is sent to
card.  Card does not expect data field of APDU because P3 must be
interpreted as *Le* field (*Lc* field is not allowed to be zero).  T0
protocol does not allow us to inform card about Ne = 0 - P3 is interpreted
as *Le* field and card accept this as Ne = 256.

Expected response is 2 bytes SW1,SW2.  After receiving procedure byte,
reader test this byte (NULL,INS,SW), and if this is not SW, new procedure
byte is waiting.

*CASE 2* (APDU length 5 bytes), header is sent to card, P3 represent the
*Le*, *Lc* is not present.  Expected response length is P3 + 2 (SW1,SW2)
bytes, for P3=0, 256 +2 bytes.  After receiving procedure byte, reader test
this byte, and if this is INS, reader reads expected response bytes.  Of
course, card may return different size of response as expected, this is not
an error.

*CASE 3* (APDU length 5 + P3 bytes), header is sent to card, P3 represent
the *Lc*, *Le* is not present.  Expected response is 2 bytes (SW1,SW2).
After receiving procedure byte, reader test this byte, and if this is INS,
reader transmit P3 bytes (DATA field of APDU) to card, then new procedure
byte is waiting.

*CASE 4* (APDU length 5 + P3 + 1 bytes) - same as for CASE 3 (there is no
way to transport *Le* to card).

Card assumes that *Ne* = 256 in this case.  Card prepares response
data and signalize back to reader how many data bytes can be returned in
next command ( by SW1 = 0x61 or SW1=0x6C, SW2 is length of data, if SW2 is 0,
256 or more data bytes are available).  It is expected, that card
reader/application software then uses GET RESPONSE command for receiving the
data, and *Ne* is handled in procedure that generated GET RESPONSE command.

From card view:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Card is waiting for 5 bytes from reader.  These bytes represent the header
of APDU.  If P3 is 0, this can not be a *Lc* field, P3 is then accepted as
*Le*.  If *Lc* is not present in APDU, then DATA field is absent too.  This
correspond to CASE 1 or CASE 2 APDU with *Ne*= 256.

If P3 != 0, this is CASE 2 or CASE 3 or CASE 4.  We need INS to determine
APDU CASE 2 - only this case need transfer from card to reader.  For CASEs
3,4 *Ne* is assumed to be 256, P3 is *Lc*/*Nc*.  For CASE 2 *Nc* is 0, P3 is
*Le*/*Ne*.

Exact definition if INS represent CASE 2 APDU is not available in ISO7816.

From ISO7816-4 all commands where Nc=0 can be assumed as candidate for APDU
CASE 2.

|==================================================================

OsEID column is checked for all INS supported by OsEID.

Some CASEs are marked by ?, if you need exact explanation about this
INS/APDU CASE, you need to read whole ISO7816.  ISO7816 is not precise
enough, for example:

ENVELOPE ISO7816-4/7.6.2 Lc field present for encoding Nc > 0, there is no
variant Nc=0, but ..  ISO7816-3/12.2.7 describes use of ENVELOPE command and
say: The absence of data bytes means "end of data string". In this case Nc=0.


Last column in the table represent INS that need transfer from card to
reader.  Conservative implementation in OsEID uses only GET RESPONSE command
that need transfer from card to reader, because any other commands can
generate status 0x61XX and then GET RESPONSE is used to return data.


Extended APDU in T0 protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Card does not have enough information about APDU case after header is
received.  Still INS and P3 can be used to allow transport of extended APDUs
over T0 protocol.

There is no way to transport command APDU with data field > 255.  Response
APDU can trasport at maximum 256 byte of response in one APDU.  In some
cases (Nc<256, Ne>256), extended APDU can be mapped to multiple APDUs to
allow receive more than 256 bytes of response.

From card view:

If card receives P3 == 0, then card assumes CASE 1 or CASE2S/E - same action
as for short APDUs.  INS can be used to determine CASE 1 or CASE 2S/E.  For
CASE 2 card assumes *Ne* 256 or more bytes (for example, RSA 4096 sign
operation a priori generates response with 512 bytes), and returns status
0x61XX.  Application software then reads up to *Ne* bytes by GET RESPONSE
command.  Of course, card may return some data and status 0x9000 - this
signalize us, that no more data are available, or new 0x61XX or 0x6cXX
status signalize us more data are available - GET RESPONSE is then used
until *Ne* bytes are received or status word 0x9000 is returned.

What about CASE 3E and 4E?, if *Nc* is < 256, P3 is set (in card reader or
application software) to *Nc* and process continues in same way as for CASE
2 S/E.  For *Nc* > 255 ENVELOPE command can be used (not allowed for now in
OsEID). Alternative to ENVELOPE command is APDU chaining (described below).



Examples for T0 protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transmit single command (select MF)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[cols="2,1,1,1,1,1,6,1",width="45%"]

| TPDU |00   | A4   | 00  | 00  | 00
|===================================================

*P3* in this case represent *Lc* field, value 0 determines here no command body.
Card responds with two bytes *SW1*,*SW2*.

[width="15%"]
|============
| SW1 | SW2
| 61  | 05
|============


If *SW1* is 0x61, and *SW2* is zero, this signalize us, that 256 or more
data can be received from card.  If *SW2* is in range 1..255, this represent
exact number of bytes that can be received from card.  To receive response,
*GET RESPONSE* command is used:

reduced to number of bytes signalized by *SW2* from card, ISO7816-3
describes value *Na* - bytes available), here 5 bytes is
requested from card.  Card return 5 bytes and new status word *SW1*,*SW2*:

If *SW2* signalize us than 5 bytes are available in card, we can receive
only part of data from card:

[width="45%"]
|==============================
|CLA  | INS  | P1  | P2  | P3
|00   | C0   | 00  | 00  | 03
|==============================

Then response consist from RDATA of maximal length of 3 bytes and new status
word *SW1*,*SW2* signalize us, than two more bytes are available in card.
(can be received by subsequent GET RESPONSE command)

[cols="8,1,1",width="65%"]
|========================
|RDATA    | SW1 | SW2
|00 01 02 | 61  | 02
|========================


If *GET RESPONSE* command set *P3* byte to value greater that *SW2* (in case
*SW1* ==0x61), then card return new status word:

[width="15%"]
|============================
| SW1 | SW2
| 6c  | 02
|===========================

this signalize us, that exact two bytes are available.

Application software repeat *GET DATA* command to receive all data from
card, last status word 0x9000 terminates this loop.  All data are
concatenated into *RDATA* and last status word is appended to this block.
This response is then returned as response APDU.  If *RDATA* is longer that
requested *Le* in command APDU, or some of status word *SW1*,*SW2* signalize
warning or error, only status word is returned as response APDU.


Transmit command with data field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,8,1",width="85%"]
|==========================================
|CLA  | INS  | P1  | P2  | P3 | DATA1|DATA2
|00   | A4   | 00  | 00  | 02 | 3f   | 00
|==========================================

This transmit is splitted into two parts, card first receive 5 bytes.  If
*P3* is not ZERO, *INS* is checked to determine meaning of P3 value.  In
case of *SELECT* command, card return *INS* byte back to reader (as
procedure byte) and then card is waiting for *P3* bytes from reader as DATA.


Response to this command is handled in same way as in previous example -
*GET RESPONSE* is used to receive *RDATA* from card.

T0 protocol limitation allow us to send at maximum 255 bytes of *DATA* bytes.

*ENVELOPE* command should be used to transmit more data in T0 protocol
(Please read ISO7816-3 12.2.7 for details), but this is not enabled in OsEID
card for now (due limited flash size)..

Alternative method may use APDU chaining (ISO7816-4 5.1.1.1).

If command generates response 256 or more bytes, 1st status word is 0x6100, and
*GET RESPONSE* is then used to read 256 bytes of response. New status word
(from *GET RESPONSE* command) then can signalize end of transport (0x9000)
or sets *SW1* to 0x61 and *SW2* to remaining bytes count.


Read data from card (no data block in command)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[width="45%"]
|==============================
|CLA  | INS  | P1  | P2  | P3
|00   | B0   | 00  | 00  | 9
|==============================


If *INS* defines read operation (in example *READ BINARY* operation), *P3* value
is used as  number of returned bytes for subsequent *GET RESPONSE*
command. If *P3* is ZERO, this mean 256 bytes is to be returned by card.

After card receive this command, there is no *INS* byte returned back to
reader (as in previous example), but *SW1*,*SW2* is returned. If *SW1* is
0x61, similar procedure as in previous example can be used to read response.


An attentive reader may notice, that card reader must support (for T0
protocol) transport of 5+255 bytes to card and 256+2 bytes from card in one
transport.


APDU mapping to T1 protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

T1 protocol uses packet oriented transport to and from card.  For details
about this, please read ISO7816-3/11.  APDU is splitted into *I* frames and
then reassembled in card back to original APDU.  State machine for this can
be found in opensource project <<CCIDusb>>, in directory src/towitoko/ and
src/openct/proto-t1.c.  Reverse joining of *I* frames can be found in OsEID
sources, in file targets/xmega128a4u/ccid.c. Of course, response APDU is
splitted in card and reassembed in reader/host.


If command APDU uses short case 4 (described above), reader must support at
minimal transport for 4+1+255+1 = 261 bytes.

If command APDU uses extended case 4, then minimal transport size is
4+3+256+2 = 265 bytes, and for maximal *Lc* 4+3+65535+2  = 65544 bytes.

Transport of responses must support 65536+2 bytes.

OsEID token integrated CCID reader allow transport  of 271 bytes in one
transport (dwMaxCCIDMsgLen = 271). CCID header need 10 bytes overhead, then
maximal message length is 261 bytes. Because *I* frames are chained, there
is no limitation in transport of extended APDU over T1 protocol, T0 is
limited - max 255 bytes in DATA field.

In this documentation APDU - TPDU mapping is described for all commands (T0
protocol).  Bytes CLA, INS, P1, P2 from APDU is mapped to TPDU without
change, byte P3 in TPDU is mapped to *Lc* or *Le* field of APDU.

APDU chaining
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

APDUs CASE 3S/E and 4S/E can be chained.  CLA must be set 0x10 for any
chained APDU and last APDU in chain must have CLA = 0.  For any APDU in
chain with CLA 0x10 *Le* field is ignored.  Only *Le* field from last APDU
in chain (CLA=0) is used.  OsEID allows to chain CLASS 3S with CASE 3E or
4S/4E APDUs. Detail about APDU chaining can be found in ISO7816-4/5.1.1.1

Warning, OsEID for now does not have support for signalizing card
capabilities (ISO7816-4/8.1.1.2.7) and because this, APDU chaining is not
signalized.




<<<
Filesystem
----------

Card uses a simple filesystem compatible with ISO7816.  However, the
functions of filesystem do not meet all the requirements defined in ISO7816. 
Please, follow the comments on these inconsistencies in the following text.

Filesystem is in ATMEGA FLASH.  Security data (PINs, PUKs) are stored in
ATMEGA EEPROM.  Filesystem is organized as simple linear structure, header,
file, header, file....  header, file.  Simplicity of filesystem limits file
delete operation.  Delete operation only marks file as deleted. 
Deallocation of file space is available only for files at end of filesystem. 
There does not exist any CRC data checks or other consistency check in
filesystem.  (Already a BETA version of FLASH friendly COW filesystem
exists, with CRC and other features, but not open source for now.  Because
of the code size it may not be available at all.  The development is
currently frozen.)

File size is limited to max 32767 bytes, DF files are always auto sized.  If
DF file is created, only the space for file header is allocated in card.  DF
file does not contain information about children, but children know what DF
is their parent.  There is no limit on number of files on card.  Filesystem
limit is 65536 bytes.  (MyEID uses PUT DATA: INITIALIZE APPLET to set
maximum number of files, this operation is supported, but value is ignored.)

Filesystem on blank card already contain two files, the file with ID=3F00
(MF) at top level and DF with ID 5015.  There is way to remove the DF 5015,
please read PUT DATA: INITIALIZE APPLET command description.  There is
difference in MyEID and OsEID card, new MyEID card comes with different
security attributes.

SELECT FILE
~~~~~~~~~~~

Selection mechanism manages current DF and current EF. If EF is selected,
parent DF is set as current DF.


[cols="1,1,1,1,1,8,1",width="85%",options="header"]
|============================================
|CLA  | INS  | P1  | P2  | P3/Lc | DATA | Le

|============================================
(CASE 1S, CASE 2S, CASE 3S, CASE 4S)

- P1 - see below
- P2 - 0 = return <<FCI>> of selected file, 0x0c - return status only

TPDU:
- P3 - in range 0..0xff, corresponding to DATA field length

APDU:
- Lc corresponding to DATA field length
- Data length corresponding to Lc
- Le maximal size of response

NOTE: If Le field is absent (T1 protocol) MyEID (4.0.1) still return FCI,
OsEID return only status bytes.  ISO7816-4:2005(E)/7.1.1: "If the Le field
is absent, ..  the response data field shall also be absent."

Select file is controlled by P1, P2 parameters. There are several P1, P2
valid combinations. For some of combinations Lc != 0 and data field must
contain specific data


- P1 = 0, P2 == 0, P3 = 0, no Lc field
  T0 protocol: CASE 2 APDU, P3 must be set to 0 - corresponds to Ne=256
  T1 protocol: CASE 1 APDU, there is no Lc/DATA/Le field
  T1 protocol: CASE 2 APDU, P3 correspond to Le field
  Select MF (0x3f00)

For rest of commands P2 is 0 or 0x0c:

- P1 = 3, P3 = 0, no Lc field
  T0 protocol: CASE 2 APDU, P3 must be set to 0 - corresponds to Ne=256
  T1 protocol: CASE 1 APDU, there is no Lc/DATA/Le field
  T1 protocol: CASE 2 APDU, P3 correspond to Le field
  Select parent DF of the current DF

- P1 = 8, P3/Lc >=2, Lc even, Data represents IDs of path to file:
  Select by path from MF (CASE 3/4)

- P1 = 9, P3/Lc >=2, Lc even, Data represents IDs of path to file:
  Select by path from current DF (CASE 3/4)

- P1 = 4, P3/Lc >0, Lc < 17, Data represents filename:
  Select DF by name (CASE 3/4)

- P1 = 1, P3/Lc = 2, Data file ID:
  Select child DF (CASE 3/4)

- P1 = 2, P3/Lc = 2, Data file ID:
  Select EF under current DF (CASE 3/4)

- P1 = 0, P2 = 0, P3/Lc = 2, Data = 0x3f00:
  Select MF (CASE 3/4)

- P1 = 0, P3=Lc = 2, Data = ID:
  Firstly the file with ID in all children of selected DF is searched, if ID is found,
  FCI/status is returned.  If previous search fails, test if parent of selected
  file matches ID.  If this fails too, file in neighbors of selected
  file is searched. (CASE 3/4)

- P2 = 0x0c - do not return <<FCI>>/<<FCP>>/<<FMD>>. This is usefull for T0
  protocol, where Ne is assumed to be 256.  Same functionality can be achieved
  if T1 protocol is used and *Le* is not present in APDU.

If select command failed, last correctly selected file remains selected.

MyEID difference: MyEID (according MyEID reference manual 2.1.4) does not
support values 1,2,3 for P1.  MyEID does not support P2 = 0x0c.
MyEID uses T1 protocol, FCI is always returned even Le is not present in
APDU (tested on MyEID 3.3.3/4.0.1).

X3h - key valid, key generated on card

X = AC to be cleared after RSA operation - due to incomplete information
about this in MyEID documentation, upper nibble is ignored by OsEID card.

If KEY file is created, 1st byte is always masked to X0h.  After successful
upload of private part of EC key or modulus of RSA key or AES/DES key
upload, the 1st byte of proprietary information is changed.  Beware, file
can be marked as valid, but not all parts of key are in file.  For EC key
this is no problem if public part is missing, but incomplete RSA key then
generates error in RSA security operation.

The DELETE FILE command does removing of file.  File must be selected by
SELECT command before calling DELETE FILE command.  If DF is selected, whole
subtree of DF is deleted too.  Before deletion of file, access condition is
checked.  After file delete operation a parent DF of deleted file is
selected.

NOTE: files are only marked as deleted, and only marked files at end of
filesystem are really deallocated and space is returned to filesystem. 
Returned space is filled by value 0xff.

If subtree operation is requested, there is no check if some DF in subtree
is marked by proprietary flag as undeletable. Only currentd DF proprietary
flag is checked.

For completeness,  ETSI TS 102 222 V7.0.0 (2006-08): Data field can be used
to specify file ID for delete operation, in this case length of data field
(Lc) is set to 2, and fiel ID is in data field.  This is not supported by
OsEID card for now.

This function can be used to erase card and return card into creation state
(Lifecycle = 1).  All PINs are erased, filesystem is erased.  Then MF and DF
5015 is recreated.  For Lc<5 MF and DF 5015 is created, default ACL are used
for this files: MF [11 3F FF], DF 5015 [11 1F FF]

If ACL0, ACL1, ACL2, are present in data (Lc >=5), MF access conditions are
set to values specified by ACL0, ACL1, ACL2.

If ACL4, ACL5, ACL6, are present in data (Lc >=8), DF 5015 access conditions are

....

NOTE: <<CRT>> here is Chinese remainder theorem

Key file length in bytes must match key size in bits (for any type of keys,
symmetric/ECC or RSA).

Before Key load operation, key file must be selected.

OsEID internally uses SIMPLE TLV to represent key parts.  Tag *T* is coded
as one 8 bit value, value 0xff is not allowed.  Because ISO7816 does not
allow value 0x00 here, there is recommended to not use key part with tag
0x00.  Length *L* represents number of bytes in field *V*.  *L* is coded as 8
bit value in range 1..254.  There is one byte at end of last component
(padding, 0xff).

OsEID allows to create key file of arbitrary size, but key upload fail if file
size does not correspond to allowed key sizes for selected cipher.  

Only proprietary EF files can be used to hold key data. Please use
the _File description byte_ values as described in the CREATE FILE
command.

For DES,  allowed size are: 56 or 64 bytes = standard DES, 128 bytes 2DES
(EDE mode), 256 bytes for 3DES (EDE mode).

For AES,  allowed sizes are: 128, 192, or 256 bytes.

For ECC keys, only private key must be uploaded, public key is not needed. 
File type is 0x22.  Allowed key sizes: 192, 256, 384 or 521 bits.  For
secp256k1 curve file type must be set to 0x23 and only 256 bit key is
allowed.  Byte size of uploaded parts must match key size i.e.  48 bytes for
384 bit private key, 66 bytes for 521 bit private key.  Public key start
with byte 04 - uncompressed indicator and consist of two coordinates witch
same length as private key i.e public key for 256 bit EC is loaded into card
as structure of 65 bytes.

For RSA keys, card uses only CRT algo, if some of CRT component is not
available, RSA operation fails.  You need to upload at least: *prime P*,
*prime Q*, *d^-1^ mod (p-1)*, *d^-1^ mod (q-1)*, *q^-1^ mod P*.

For now, public exponent is not needed by OsEID card, card internaly uses
hardcoded public exponent 65537. Future version of OsEID card may need this
part too (for message blinding and Belcore attack protection), therefore,
it is recommended to upload *public exponent*.

Card allows upload modulus, but internaly this operation does nothing. If
card is asked for modulus (GET DATA), modulus is calculated from P and Q.

2048 bit modulus is uploaded in two parts, order of part upload  does not
matter (MyEID need first upload 1st part, the second). There is alternative
upload method for 2048 bit modulus, APDU chaining can be used to put whole
modulus in one operation.

Card allows to upload *private exponent*, but this operation does nothing.

Upload operation does not check size/value of modulus and private exponent.

Components with ID 0xA3/0xB3 and 0xA4/0xB4 are not standard CRT components.
Precalculating of these values allows us to speed up RSA calculation. Card
automatically calculates these values from P and Q components, user is not
allowed to upload these components.  This functionality is optional, can be
turned off at compilation time.

GENERATE PUBLIC KEY PAIR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This command generates RSA/ECC keys.  This command operates on current
selected file.  Key type and size is determined from selected file.  If file
type/size does not match allowed key length for cipher, operation fails.

|========================================================================
(CASE 4S)

P1,P2=0, this indicate proprietary format of data field (ISO7816-8).

RSA key for now uses fixed public exponent 65537.  For RSA key, user can set
Lc to 0 or set Lc and data field with this public exponent:

All three formats are identical. First format  does not define public
exponent, the card then uses default public exponent. If Lc is not 0, data
field contain ASN1 formated data for public exponent. Only value 65537 is
accepted.

Data field is ASN1 formated, 0x30 is SEQUENCE indicator, and value 0x02 or
0x81 is used as "public exponent" tag.  (ASN.1 uses 0x02 as tag for INTEGER, 
MyEID 2.1.4 manual defines here tag 0x02 too. Opensc 0.17 send
0x81 here, OsEID for now allows both values).

If key is successfully generated, key file is filled with key data and card
returns public modulus.

- P1,P2=0, this indicate proprietary format of data field (ISO7816-8).
- P3 = 0
- Lc = empty
- Data empty
- LE 3 + [key size in bites] * 2 / 8


This APDU is same as specified in MyEID reference manual 2.1.4. As you can
see, there is no information about key size or OID of cipher. Only one way to
detect number of key bits exists -  key file size. If you need to generate ECC
key on card, key file size in bytes must match key length in bits.

APDU returns public key in format:
0x86 - TAG
0xXX - LEN (or 0x81, LEN for 521 bit key)
0x04 - uncompressed indicator
0xXX .. 0xXX - X coordinate of public key
0xXX .. 0xXX - Y coordinate of public key

It is surprising that MyEID does not use for example OID of curve in the
DATA section to specify the key absolutely precisely. OsEID may in future use
proprietary APDU thats allows to specify OID of curve in data field, but if
*OpenSC* does not support this information, this feature is for now not
interesting.


Card security mechanism functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Files and directories on card are protected by access flags. If file
operation is protected by access flag, access flag can deny or allow
operation on file. 

PIN create is allowed only before using ACTIVATE APPLET command.

VERIFY
^^^^^^

Verify command is used to authenticate user/application to card. 
Command allows to send verification data (e.g password/PIN) to card.
The verification data is compared to reference data stored in card. 
The card security status is modified according to this comparison. 

Card supports maximal 14 security access conditions.

A successful comparison enables use of card function controlled by security
access condition, which number is in P2 parameter of APDU.  Counter
of unsuccessful verify attempts is then cleared.  

For unsuccessful comparison, counter of unsuccessful verify attempts is
incremented and if this counter is over predefined value, PIN
is blocked. PIN can be unblocked by PUK.

PIN can be optionally marked as LOCKED, verification to locked PIN always fails.
For more about PIN LOCK feature check CHANGE REFERENCE DATA command.

If Lc != 0, data in APDU are used as verification data. Normally exact 8
bytes are present in APDU Data section and Lc is set to 8.  PIN in Data
section of APDU is padded by 0xff or 0x00.  If APDU present more data, rest

padded with 0xff.

- P1, P2, Lc, Data, - arbitrary data are accepted

This command activates card security mechanism of card, all access conditions
become active.

Difference to MyEID: MyEID needs applet <<AID>> in Data field, P1 must be set to
4 and P2 to 0.  Applet AID must be set to A000000063504B43532D3135.  MyEID
card allow activation only if PIN corresponding to MF recreation access
condition is already initialized, otherwise card return SW1,2 = 0x6985
(Conditions not satisfied).  OsEID always allow activation.  If PIN that
allow recreation of MF is not initialized, there is no possibility to erase
the activated card (only way for reuse activated card is reprogramming card
CPU).

Cryptographic functions
----------------------

Card supports several cryptographic functions. Symmetric cryptographic
functions are available and asymmetric cryptography is available.

Support for symmetric cryptography is experimental for now, because it is based
only on MyEID 2.1.4 reference manual.  Internally OsEID support AES
encrypt/decrypt with standard block size 16 bytes, and key sizes 128/192/256
bits in ECB mode.  DES encrypt/decrypt in ECB is supported with standard
block size 8 bytes, and standard key size 64 bits (56 bits + parity bits,
but all parity bits are ignored).  Support for 3DES encrypt/decrypt is for
192 bit key size, all three keys independent (3TDEA).  Only EDE keying is
supported, no EEE.  This allow run 2 DES too, if 3rd key is copy of 1st key
(2TDEA).  Maximal key size is then 192 bits, but real security of this cipher
is about 112 bits.

Block chaining is not available for now, but it seems that MyEID uses CBC
mode, and in future this mode is planed as default.  OsEID for now uses only
ECB mode for AES and DES.  Data size for DES operation is then limited for
only 8 bytes block per operation (APDU) and one 16 bytes block AES operation.

Asymmetric cryptography supports RSA with key sizes 512 to 2048 bits
(512,768,1024,1536,2048).  There is support for private operation only.
This allows to use RSA for decipher and for sign operation.  Elliptic curve
cryptography support is available for small set of curves: prime192v1,
prime256v1, secp384r1, secp256k1.  ECDH and ECDSA are supported.


The following procedure is recommended for the execution of a security
operation:

- use SELECT FILE operation to specify file with key/private key 
- use VERIFY command to get access condition for key file
- use MANAGE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT command to set parameters of security
- use PERFORM SECURITY OPERATION or GENERAL AUTHENTICATE to perform 
  requested operation


MANAGE SECURITY ENVIRONMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,8,1",width="85%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|CLA  | INS  | P1 | P2  | P3/Lc  | Data | Le
|0x00 | 0x22 |... | ... | ...    | ...  | empty
|==============================================
(CASE 3S)

P1 structure:
  X1h - set security environment
  X2h - store security environment
  X3h - restore security environment
  X4h - erase security environment

  1Xh - Secure Messaging (command)
  2Xh - Secure Messaging (response)
  4Xh - Computation, decipherment, internal authentication and key agreement
  8Xh - Verification, encipherment, external authentication and key agreement

Any other value RFU (ISO7816-4, Table 78)

P2 value is used to determine *Control Reference Template* in data field.

  0xA4 = Authentication Template (AT)
  0xA6 = Key Agreement Template (KAT)
  0xAA = Hash-code Template (HT)
  0xB4 = Cryptographic Checksum Template (CCT)
  0xB6 = Digital Signature Template (DST)
  0xB8 = Confidentiality Template (CT)

Any other value RFU (ISO7816-4, Table 79)



OsEID allow only limited set of P1/P2 values:

[width="85%",options="header"]
|====================================================
|   P1  |  P2  | operation
|  0xF3 |  0   | restore empty security environment
|  0x41 | 0xA4 | set SE for ECDH operation
|  0x41 | 0xB6 | set SE for digital signature
|  0x41 | 0xB8 | set SE for decipher operation
|  0x81 | 0xB8 | set SE for encipher operation
|=====================================================

If P2 != 0 there is Lc != 0, LE = 0 and corresponding template must be
filled in data field.

Data field represents concatenated Tag Len Value objects.
....
TAG 80h Algorithm reference,
LEN 1 Value: XXh

Value specification:

X0h - RAW RSA signature/decipher
X1h - RSA signature, IEC9796-2  randomized  with hash (below hash specifications)
X2h - pad data to match modulus (PKCS#1 padding)
X4h - ECDSA/ECDH

0Xh - no hash algo
1Xh - SHA1
2Xh - RIPEMD-160
3Xh - SHA-2 224 bit
4Xh - SHA-2 256 bit
5Xh - SHA-2 384 bit
6Xh - SHA-2 512 bit
80h - PKCS#7 padding
....


OsEID supports only small set of algorihm reference

....
00h - Raw operation - data length must match key modulus length

02h - for decipher: remove padding from data
02h - for signatures: concatenate PKCS#1 padding || signature data
      (do not use data over 60% of key size, minimal padding is 11 bytes)
12h - for decipher: same as raw operation
12h - for signatures: concatenate padding || SHA1 OID || signature data
      (here always 20 bytes of signature data is allowed)

04h - ECDSA, ECDH operation
....

For LEN = 10, OID of cryptograhics mechanism in data field (not supported in
OsEID) 



....
TAG 81h, File reference
LEN 2 Value: XXXXh file ID
....

ID is used to select the file which contains the key for the next security
operation.  This file is selected by same way as SELECT operation with
P1 = 2 (DF can not be selected here).  If file is not selectable, operation
return _Conditions not satisfied_ return code (0x6985).  This operation does
not affect current selected file selected by previous SELECT command.

Any other length is not supported by OsEID (More about referencing in ISO7816-4,
5.3.1.2)

....
TAG 0x82  DF id/name - is not used in OsEID (More about referencing DF in
ISO7816-4, 5.3.1.1)
....

....
TAG 83h or 84h, LEN 1
....

Tag 83h is for key file with symmetric key, 84h for file with asymmetric key.
Not used, must not be present. Reference for key in keyfile.
If present, only value 0 is correct.

TAG 83h or 84, LEN 2
Tag 83h is used here for ID of target file for UNWRAP operation. File is
searched in same way as for tag 0x81.

From ISO 7816-4 terminology for 0x83/0x84 tag:
0x83: reference for a secret key (direct use), or reference of a public key
or qualifier of reference data
0x84: reference for computing a session key or reference of a private key



....
TAG 0x85 and 0x86 is not used
....

....
TAG 87h
....
Set initialization vector.  Must not be present.  If not present, then
initialization vector is undefined. Length from 1 to 16 bytes.


In future, for length = 0, previous IV +1 is to be used. Beware, OsEID
functions with symmetric keys is still experimental.



Minimal template must have tag 0x80 and tag 0x81.


PERFORM SECURITY OPERATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,8,1",width="85%",options="header"]
|=========================================
|CLA  | INS  | P1 | P2  | Lc  | Data | LE
|...  | 0x2A |... | ... | ... | ...  | ...
|=========================================
(CASE 4S)

Before security operation correct security environment must be set.
Access condition must allow use of selected key file.

Command uses key file defined by SET SECURITY ENVIRONMENT command. Actualy
selected file by SELECT command is not affected by this operation.

More types of security operations exists:


. Compute digital signature (ECC/RSA)
  (In case of RSA, use data field length max 40% of modulus length)

*   CLA = 00h or 80h
*   P1 = 9Eh perform digital signature
*   P2 = 9Ah data to be signed in data field (plain data)
*   Lc = length of data

MyEID as described in reference manual 2.1.4 does not support RSA 2048 raw
sign operation, but this operation is identical to raw decipher operation.
Please use *OpenSC* version from *git*, there is already fix that allows raw
2048 bit signature.
https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commit/deab9cce73377f973d2020ab5ab7adc302018bf6
Opensc 0.18.0 already contain this patch.

APDU chaining is available in OsEID card, for 2048 raw signature this
transport is preferred.  (MyEID from version 4.5.X allow use of APDU
chaining too).

+
Alternatives not supported by OsEID:

*   P2 = ACh BER-TLV data (only value field is to be signed) in data field
*   P2 = BCh BER-TLV to be signed in data field
*   Lc = 0 data already present in card

. Encipher plaintext (DES/3DES/AES128/AES192/AES256)

*   CLA = 80h
*   P1 = 84h - return encrypted data
*   P2 = 80h - plaintext in data field
*   P2 = 00h - data field absent, use data from file (wrap)
*   Lc = length of plaintext

+
Alternatives not supported by OsEID:

*   P1 = 82h return encrypted SM object
*   P1 = 86h return encrypted data (this depend on padding indicator)

. Decipher ciphertext (RSA/DES/3DES/AES128/AES192/AES256)

*  CLA = 00h or 80h
*  P1 = 0 - no data is to be returned, result of operation is in file
            specified in security environment (tag 0x84) - used in UNWRAP operation
*  P1 = 80h - return plain value
*  P2 = 84h - data field contain ciphertext (Experimental)
*  P2 = 86h - data field contain padding indicator, then partial or full ciphertext
*  Lc = length of ciphertext/ciphertext part + length of padding indicator if used

APDU chaining is available in OsEID card, for 2048 decipher operation  this
transport is preferred.  (MyEID from version 4.5.X allow use of APDU
chaining too).

+
Alternatives not supported by OsEID:

*   P2 = 82h encrypted SM objects in data field

Rest of commands are not supported by OsEID:

. Compute Cryptographic Checksum

*   P1 = 0x8E
*   P2 = 0x80

. Verify Cryptographic Checksum

*   P1 = 0    - do no treturn any data
*   P2 = 0xA2

+
   Return codes are 0x9000, 0x6987 - checksum fail, 0x6988 - SM object(s) incorrect

. Verify Digital Signature

*  P1 = 0  - do not return any data (SW1,2 is used to test if signature is valid)
*  P2 = 0xA8

. Verify certificate

*  P1 - 0x00  do not return any data (SW1,2 is used to test if cert is valid)
*  P2 - 0x92
*  P2 - 0xBE, or 0xAE self-descriptive/non-self descriptive certificate

*   data      Certificate in the data field, signed signature input consists of non
              BER-TLV-coded data: the certificate content is a concatenation of
	      <<DE>>s)
. Hash

*   P1 = 0x90
*   P2 = 0x80 or 0xa0




Padding methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If P2 = 0x86, 1st byte of ciphertext is padding byte. Allowed padding bytes:
....
00h = rest of data field is ciphertext (no futher indication)
02h = rest of data field is ciphertext (No padding) (Not supported by OsEID)
81h = rest of data field is 1st part of ciphertext (MyEID/OsEID proprietary)
82h = rest of data field is last part of ciphertext (MyEID/OsEID proprietary)
....


If padding indicator is set to 0, rest of data is handled as ciphertext.
APDU chaining is allowed to allow transport up to 256 bytes of data.

If paddig indicator set to 0x81, card saves 1st part of ciphertext in
temporary buffer.  Status 0x9000 is returned.  In all other cases the card
returns result of security operation and status bytes.  If APDU with padding
indicator 0x82 is received, new data are concatenated with data from
privious APDU (with padding indicator 0x81) and card performs security
operation.  Maximum length of concatenated ciphertext is 256 bytes.  APDU
chaining is not allowed with this type of padding indicators.

Warning, temporary buffer is overwritten by any command that returns data
(not only status bytes).

MyEID manual 2.1.4 limits P2 = 0x84 (ISO7816-4 0x84: cryptogram plain value
encoded in BER-TLV, not SM data object) for AES/DES decipher.  For RSA
decipher P2 = 0x86 is requested.  OsEID allows both values for AES/DES/RSA
decipher.  OsEID allows arbitrary length of ciphertext parts for padding
indicators 81h and 82h.  MyEID manual 2.1.4 defines use of this padding
indicators for 2048 bit keys.

WARNING!  OsEID support for DES and AES security operation is experimental.
If selected key file contain AES/DES key, security operation is allowed only
for CLA = 0x80.  Digital signature security operation is not supported if
AES/DES key is selected. Data size (Lc) must match block size of DES /AES
block.

OsEID does not support templates for now, but for completeness:

Templates:
0xA0 - Input template to calculate the hash code (template hashed)
0xA2 - Input template for checking a cryptographic checksum (template is integrated)
0xA8 - Digital signature verification input template (template signed)
0xAC - Input template for calculating the digital signature (the associated value fields are signed)
0xAE - Certificate Input Verification Template (associated value field certified)
0xBC - Input template for calculating a digital signature (template signed)
0xBE - Entry Template for Certificate Verification (Certified Template)

Input data object

0x80 Explicit meaning		All templates
0x8E Cryptographic checksum	0xA2,0xAE,0xBE
0x90 Hash			All except 0xA2
0x92 Certificate		0xAE,0xBE
0x9C Public key			0xA8,0xAE,0xBE
0x9E digital signature		0xA8,0xAE,0xBE


ECDH security operation is handled by GENERAL AUTHENTICATE command.




GENERAL AUTHENTICATE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,8,1",width="85%",options="header"]
|=========================================
|CLA  | INS  | P1 | P2  | Lc  | Data | LE
| 0   | 0x86 | 0  |  0  | ... | ...  | ..
|=========================================
(CASE 4S)

This command is used to provide ECDH operation. Before calling this command,
correct security environment must be set and key file must be selected.

Lc   - correspond to length of data field
Data - peer public key in format:  0x7c, Lc-2 0x85 Lc-4 0x04 point_data
Here: 0x7c is Dynamic Authentication Template tag
      0x85 public key in data field
      0x04 uncompressed key indicator

In addition to tag 0x85 tag 0x80 (Witness tag) is allowed with an arbitrary
length.  This tag is ignored for now.

Card returns shared secret derived from private key in selected file and
public key provided in APDU. Technically, this operation does a point
multiplication and X coordinate of calculated point is returned.

For more info, please read *OsEID-tool* - ECDH operation.


GET CHALLENGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[cols="1,1,1,1,1",width="85%",options="header"]
|================================
|CLA  | INS  | P1 | P2  | P3/Le
| 0   | 0x84 | 0  |  0  | ...
|================================
(CASE 2S)

Le - number of requested random data (1..255)

Card return 1..255 bytes of random data.

Please read appendix *Random generator implementation* about random number
generator.

Return values:
- 0x9000 - All OK
- 0x6f00 - if number of requested bytes is zero.

Note: In future here comes more P1/P2 values, thats allow us to
authenticate by challenge/response.  There is consideration about requested
number of random data bytes, for Le=0, 256 bytes of random data may be
returned.

image::images/token1.png[OeEID-token]

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Based on easily accessible microcontroller Microchip/Atmel xmega128A4U
* single sided PCB
* integrated CCID reader and card in one microcontroller
* no driver needed for windows/linux - emulation of Gemalto reader
* T0 and T1 protocol, TPDU exchange level
* RSA speed: 2048 - about 10 second, 1536 about 5 seconds, 1024 about 1.7 seconds
* ECC speed: secp384r1 about 2.5 seconds, prime256v1 about 1.1 seconds
* low suspend current
* two LEDs to signalize reader/card operation
* optional button to approve sign/decrypt operations
* full speed USB device with electrostatic discharge protection

(RSA speed tested on decrypt operation, time is difference between transmit
ciphertext and receive decrypted data.  The time may vary depending on the
USB host.)

Drawbacks
~~~~~~~~~
Drawback are similar to OsEID card. But one significant drawback should be
pointed up:

* USB and CCID code in same microcontroller as card code reduces security of device
  (due complexity of code, bug in CCID/USB code can compromise card code
  and lead to getting private keys from card.

P2 connector is realized only by pads on PCB. Connector is used to program
xmega by PDI programmer.  Needle spring probe is used to connect programmer
to P2 connector.

Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~
You need programmer that support PDI programming. One open source/open
hardware can be found at:

https://www.olimex.com/Products/AVR/Programmers/AVR-ISP-MK2/open-source-hardware

To connect programmer to token, you need connector with spring needles
(contacts pitch 2mm).  Create a reduction from this connector to your PDI
programmer.  Use schematics of token and pin description of your programmer,
to get correct connection.  (P2 connector: 1st PIN to CPU is PDI, then
RESET, + and GND).  Make sure that programmer is set up to power device with
3.3V!

$ avrdude -p x128a4u -c avrispmkII -v -U fuse2:w:0xBF:m
----

Compiling from sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compiling is similar to ATmega128 version:

----
make -f Makefile.xmega128a4u
make -f Makefile.xmega128a4u fuses
make -f Makefile.xmega128a4u program
----

Overclocking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overclocking is not recommended, but if someone need this, there is a simple
way to do this. CPU clock is defined in file *targets/xmega128a4u/avr_os.c*

....
// use PLL - multiply 2MHz RC oscilator to 32MHz
  OSC.PLLCTRL = OSC_PLLSRC_RC2M_gc | (32 / 2);
....

Overwrite multiplication factor *(32 / 2)* to requested value (for example
*(48 / 2)*). Recompile and program your token.

There is lot of information about XMEGA overclocking on internet.  Some
people run XMEGA over 50MHz and more without any problems.  Some other
people report problems with EEPROM on overclocked XMEGAs.  If your XMEGA
burns, this is your problem.  Please, read again disclaimer section in this
manual.

AVR arithmetics
---------------

Addition, subtraction and rotate/shift operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These operations are relatively simple, but to achieve desired speed,
operations are partially unrolled.  In one unrolled step 32 or 64 bit of
operands are processed.

Multiplication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AVR multiplication is based on karatsuba multiplication.  It uses modified
open source (public domain) implementation from Michael Hutter and Peter
Schwabe <<AVR_KARATSUBA>>.  256 bit multiplication code is fully revised to
enable run in interrupt safe way (stack pointer change is protected by CLI
instruction.) Code is faster, original code took 4797 clock cycles (in
branched version), new code is about 6% faster and about 7% smaller.
Similar changes are made in 192 bit multiplication.

The 128 bit multiplication is used only for 512 bit RSA.  Because 512 bit
key is not safe today, it makes no sense to waste lot of flash for this
multiplication.  Here simple looped code is used and this code is able to
calculate truncated multiplication (low part of result) too. Another 128 bit
multiplication (karatsuba based) is integrated inside truncated 256 bit
multiplication.

192 and 256 bit squaring was written from scratch, it uses similar method as

<<AVR_SQUARING>> is running in 1966/3253 clock cycles for 192/256 bit
squaring.

Modular multiplicative inversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modular multiplicative inversion is based on left shift, similar to
<<Lorencz>> or more similar to <<Hars>> shifting Euclidean algorithm.  AVR
microcontroller shift/rotate instruction allow us to rotate 8 bit value only
by one bit in one instruction cycle.  Original Hars algorithm is not usable
without modifications (very slow repetitive rotations of V/S by 'f').  The
goal is to minimize the number of rotations.

In each step of algorithm 'U' and 'V' is aligned (by left rotations) on
highest non zero bit, then this bit is eliminated by subtraction.  'R' and
'S' are kept updated similar to 'U' and 'V'.  This step is repeating, but
align is done by right rotation, until bit size of 'U' is bigger that bit
size of 'V'.  If this is not true, 'U' and 'V' ('R' and 'S') are swapped, and
all rotations are returned back (right).  This procedure is repeating until
bit size of 'U' is zero or one (no inversion exists or inversion found).

The 'U' and 'V' are represented as unsigned number, but there are helper
variables 'sU' and 'sV' for storing the signs of 'U' and 'V'.  'R' and 'S'
variables use 64 more bits (this is enough to use 1 more bit to represent
two's complement number, but arithmetics routines are unrolled and use 8 bytes
step).

Only C code is available for now, ASM version is planned.  Implementation
allows us to calculate inversion for even modulus too (this is needed for
calculation of CRT components).  Code is designed to be small, the speed of
the algorithm is not significant.  (In versions before 20171231, right shift
binary Euclidean algorithm was used, but this doesn't allows us to calculate
CRT components because modulus is always even number.  This code is smaller
as new code but is slower too.)



Modulo operation and modular reduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modulo operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Up to the  version 20190102 modulo operation uses binary division algorithm.
The rotate/shift operation, as mentioned before, is slow on AVR devices,
table of 8 rotated modulus values are used to save lot of rotate
instructions.  AVR assembler version of this code needs 262593 clock cycles
for 1024 bit number (575021 clock cycles for 1536, 1008281 clock cycles for
2048).  The code run in constant time.

To speed up this part of code, new code uses precalculated constant 'Bc'.
Reduction speed up is based on modificied Barrett method described in
<<Hasenplaugh>>.

Let 'M' be modulus of 'n' bits length.  Number 'N' is to be reduced by 'M'.
Maximal bit length of 'N' is '2n'.  Constant 'Bc' of maximal bit length 'n'
is calculated from:

'Bc = 2^1.5n^ mod M  				(1)'

To calculate 'Bc' binary division algorithm is used. Number 'N' can be
reduced to partial result number 'Rp' (maximal bit length '1.5n+1'):


'Rp = N mod 2^1.5n^ + (N >> 1.5n) * Bc 		(2)'


Calculating 'N mod 2^1.5n^' is not an extensive operation - low part of 'N' up
to '1.5n' bits is a result of this operation.  Rotation '>>' is not extensive
too, upper '0.5n' bits of 'N' is a result of this operation.  Multiplication
with 'Bc' uses two '0.5n' bits multiplications.

'Rp' is then reduced to final 'R' ('R < M') by  binary division algorithm
but there is only '1+1.5n' bits to reduce not '2n' bits.


Only for completeness, there is some things that can be observed:

If number 'N' is result of multiplication of two numbers  'A < M', 'B < M',
and 'Rp' of bit length '1+1.5n' is result form (2), then result 'R < M' can
be computed by at most three subtractions of 'M << 0.5n' from 'Rp'

In RSA cryptosystem, prime 'P' and 'Q' has highest bit always set to 1 (i.e.
0x8001 for n=16, 'M' in this calculation corresponds to 'P' or 'Q').  At
most two substraction of 'M << 0.5n' is enough to reduce 'Rp' to maximum
'1.5n' bits.  This is also true for any 'A < 2^n^, B < 2^n^'



Modular reduction inside RSA exponentiation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For commonly used  Montgomery exponentiation we need to calculate two values:
'x1 = 1 * r mod M' and 'x2 = msg * r mod M'.  Additionally we need
precomputed constant 'Mc' calculated from 'r * r^-1^ - M * Mc = 1'.  Here
'r' is in form 'r = 2^k^'.  The smallest possible 'k' is chosen so that
'r > N'. "M' must be a odd number ('M' and 'r' must be relatively prime).

For calculation of 'Mc' modified Euclidean algorithm is used, where similar
table for 'N' is used as in modulo operation.  Code is in AVR assembler,
calculation needs only 188300 clock cycles for 512 bit modulus length
(400684 clock cycles for 768 bit, 694988 clock cycles for 1024).

For calculating 'x1 = 1 * r mod n' similar code can be used as for
calculating 'x2 = msg * r mod n', but we can use special property of 'r' to
avoid division in this calculation ( <<RSA_high_speed>> page 48, chapter 3.8.1.
claims need of division in this step ).

If 'n < 2^k^ < 2 * n',  then '2^k^ mod n = 2^k^ - n'.  Here negated 'n'
('0 - n') can be used directly as 'x'.

Reduction steps to reduce 'N' of size '2n' bits to result 'Rp' of maximal
bit length 'n+1':

'a = ((N mod 2^n^ ) * Mc ) mod 2^n^		(3)'

'b = a * N 					(4)'

'Rp = (N + b) >> n				(5)'

If 'Rp > M', one subtraction of 'Rp - M' is sufficient to get result 'R <
M'.


OsEID used Montgomery reduction up to version 20190102. Newer version uses
better method.

Because 'N' can be reduced to 'Rp'  with bit length '1+1.5n' by algorithm
described above in modulo operation, only '0.5n' bits from low part of 'Rp'
must be reduced by Montgomery reduction.  This allows us to choose 'k' as
'1+0.5n'.  Calculation of 'x1 = 1 * r mod N' is then eliminated, because '1 *
r' is always below 'N'.  Calculation of 'x2' is faster, only '1+1.5n' must
be reduced instead of '2n' bits.  Calculation of 'Mc' is faster, we need
only '0.5n' bits.


Reduced Montgomery algorithm first calculates help variable 'a' with bit
size '0.5n' from already reduced 'Rp' by truncated multiplication (only low
'0.5n' bits  are used):

'a = ((Rp mod 2^0.5n^) *  Mc) mod 2^0.5n^ 		(3*)'

For reducing 'Rp' we need to calculate number 'b' which is added to 'Rp'
and this addition zeroize low '0.5n' bits in 'Rp'

'b = a * N 						(4*)'

Computing 'b' cost only two half sized (0.5n) multiplications. Finally result
'R' is calculated:

'R = (Rp + b) >> (0.5n)					(5*)'

Maximal bit length of 'R' is '2+n' bits and to reduce this to bit length not
greater that 'n' up to two subtractions of 'N' is needed. Of course, result
'R' is in Montgomery form and it is not necessarily that 'R < M'.

To get final result after exponentiation, one more step is needed -
multiplication by '1' and Montgomery reduction.  This reduction always need
at maximum one subtraction of 'M' to guarantee final result 'R < M'.


Old code uses three '0.5n'  sized multiplications in Karatsuba
multiplication, then one '0.5n' sized multiplication and two '0.5n' sized
truncated multiplications are used to construct one 'n' sized truncated
multiplication.

New code need only '0.5n' sized truncated multiplications and four '0.5n'
sized multiplications.


Old and new code need some overhead for additions  and subtractions. Finally,
old code with full sized  Montgomery reduction for reducing 1024 bit to 512
bit need about 27000 clock cycles. New code needs only 24300 clock cycles.


Maybe this algorithm reminds someone of so-called bipartite Modular
multiplication but there is difference in reduction of upper bits. Bipartite
method uses some multiply of 'n' to reduce upper part of 'N'. This code is
different, there is no multiply of 'n' added to 'N'.

Someone may ask, why there is not used Barrett folding as described in
<<Hasenplaugh>>.  This method need multiplication of operands with '1+0.5n'
and '0.5n' size.  Even this can be calculated with normal '0.5n'
multiplication and some addition (using the AND instruction for one more bit
in operand), it will introduce more overhead as in explained algorithm.
Then there is '1+n' and 'n' operand size in final part of folding, this
introduce second overhead.  It can be guessed, that currently implemented
algorithm is faster (on 8 bit AVR platform).



ECC operation speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EC calculation uses projective coordinates.  Lot of code is inspired by NIST
<<NIST_ECC>> and <<OPENCRYPTOTOKEN>> EC point doubling is optimized for NIST
curves and for secp256k1 curve.  EC point multiplication is designed as
constant time, with multiplication window of 4 bits.  Point multiplication
is blinded.  For each supported curve, a separate fast reduction algorithm
is used. The secp521r1 curve is supported only on devices with 8KB RAM and
more (ATmega 1284, xmega128A4U). Firmware for atmega128 microcontroller can
be recompiled with two bits multiplication window, then secp521r1 is running
on this device.

RSA operation speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the next table, there is  RSA calculation timing in clock cycles (normal
RSA / precalculated constants for modulo and P^-1^ mod R and Q^-1^ mod R in
key file), interrupt always enabled.  Exponentiation window is not optimal
to any key size - optimal window for key size 512/768 is 4 bits, not 5, but
code uses fixed size defined at compilation time (based on RAM size of
device) for all key sizes.  Because 512/768 bit key is not safe today, it
makes no sense to optimize 512/768 bit calculation for window size 5 bits.

To reach this, lot of  assembler routines are used, especially Montgomery
algo and function like mul256 mod 2^256^ (truncated multiplication).  To get
best possible performance, the 384, 512, 768 and 1024 bit squaring and
multiplication are unrolled as possible, with respect to flash memory size
in AVR.

Code size: about 20 000 lines in AVR assembler, about 10000 lines in C. AVR
flash in ATmega128 is occupied by ~ 63kB code, 64Kb is used as data space for
card filesystem. RAM is almost full, there is approximately 80 bytes free in
atmnega128 (4kB RAM space).

Cryptographic algorithm security
--------------------------------

RSA security
~~~~~~~~~~~~

OsEID implements several protections to generally known attacks to RSA
cryptosystem. There exists several types of side channel attacks:

Simple Power Analysis (SPA) / timing attack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To prevent this type of attack, OsEID uses:

 * constant time calculation (time does not depend on key or message value)
 * Exponentiation uses fixed window size, window is not sliding, zeros 
   are not skipped. 

_RSA implementation in OsEID card is resistant to SPA / timing attack._

Differential Power Analysis (DPA)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To prevent this type of attack, OsEID uses:

 * card uses exponent blinding

In default settings 24 bits random value is used to blind private exponent
parts (dP and dQ).  Exponent blinding is a big barrier for lot of advanced
techniques that allow use of side channel attack to expose private keys.

 * Card does not support message blinding <<RSA_MSG_BLINDING>>
 
Due constant time of operation (no variable length sliding window), it is
not possible to use known attacks which could work due to the absence of a
message blinding.

 * Card does not support modulus blinding

Modular reduction is needed to calculate Montgomery product like `1 * r mod
n` and `M * r mod n`.  In both cases, `n` is secret value P or Q.  Due CRT
calculation there are operations like `M mod P` and `M mod Q`.  Modular
reduction is running in constant time, but is not blinded.  There is a way
to extract power fingerprint from this operation.  It is necessary to run
lot of power traces to get reliable power fingerprint from the same message. 
Several special formated messages must be traced to get some information
about P/Q.  Because number of analyzed messages run over 30 000, this type
of attack is not realistic for now.  More about this attack to this function
can be found in <<DPA_on_modular_reduction>>.

Because missing message blinding, there is another point that allow extract
some information from card.  CRT recombination (Garner`s algorithm) 
produce result, that need conditional addition.  This addition is always
realized, but power trace can be used to detect which of two possible
results is used as return value.  It's not easy to detect this step in one
power trace, but the correlation of a very large number of power traces may
leak some information about this step.

Montgomery product needs `n'` from equation `r* r^-1 - n * n' = 1`.  This
calculation is running in constant time, but is not blinded.  There is a way
to use DPA for extracting some information about P and Q from card.  In
default firmware configuration, this calculation is running only in key
upload operation, therefore the security of this algorithm is for now
irrelevant.

_RSA implementation in OsEID card is (reasonably) resistant to DPA attack_

Algorithm problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RSA implementation uses <<CRT>> (China Remainder Theorem).  <<SINGLE_ERROR>>
in CRT implementation can expose private key.  This is also known as
<<BELLCORE>> attack. To prevent this type of attack, OsEID uses:

  * result of exponentiation is checked by public exponent.

This extends the calculation time by approximately 2% for 2048 bits to 5%
for 512 bits RSA.  CRT recombination is not protected, but injecting fault
precisely into this point is very difficult.  Implementing full check
(exponenting signature by public exponent) is problematic due RAM and FLASH
size limitation.  There is not protection against wrong loaded P or Q from
key storage!  There is about 10 msec interval for 1024 bit key for
injecting error in message mod P/Q calculation and about 38 msec if 2048
bit key is used. Intervals for OsEID token are about 2.5x shorter.

There is lot of methods to inject error into microcontroller calculation,
fotons from laser/flash light can be used or some particle from radioactive
isotope or electrostatic discharge etc.  Is very difficult to hit exact time
and exact part of microcontroller (for example do not hit program counter but
hit only some of registers or ALU, exact part of RAM etc.), lot of attempt
is needed and lot of luck is needed.  Usually any of attempts ends with
halted microcontroller or in worst case with total damage of
microcontroller.

_RSA implementation in OsEID card is (reasonably) resistant to Bellcore attack_

RSA key generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OsEID supports RSA key generation.  This operation is really slow, but is
not subject to <<ROCA>>.  There is really random prime selection algorithm
used for RSA key generation.

Number from random generator is modified - highest  and lowest bit are set
to 1 and this number is then tested by simple sieve - division by 1st 130
primes - and then Miller-Rabin test is used as primality test.  There is no
hardware divisor in AVR devices, GCD is used to check all 130 primes in one
step (product of 1st 130 primes can be fitted into 1024 bit value, this
value is one operand in GCD, second operand is tested number).

Number is considered to be a prime number if pass the Rabin-Miller test.
Rabin-Miller test consider number to be a prime after several loops with
different parameter 'A'.  Number of loops is based on length of a tested
prime.  (Listed in row  "MR loop pass").

|=====================================================================

When both primes are found, they are tested if they are not too close to
each other.  Then modulus is calculated, and tested if modulus is not too
short (if highest bit is not set - short modulus).  Finally RSA components
are calculated.  If some of test fails, both primes are discarded and two
new primes are searched.  This handling prevents unnecessary bias of
prime/modulus value.

Most often, we need to generate 4 primes (only 33% probability to generate
good P,Q who are not rejected due small product P*Q or P,Q is too close
together).

| time - token (seconds) | 0.054 | 0.063   | 0.075
|=================================================


For one prime (512 bit) we need in average 147 GCD operations, total time
147*0.148 = about 22 seconds.  Then 29+6 Miller-Rabin test (one about 1.9 sec)
= about 66.5 seconds.  For one prime we need in average 89 seconds.

Generation of 1024 bit key (4 primes ) then take in average about 6 minutes,
but in worst case over 30 minutes.

When generating a 2048 bit key you have to be very patient.  Count with time
1 to 3 hours.  (One Miller-Rabin test run in about 11 second - there is
really no way to run this faster with only one 8 bit multiplier in AVR)

Keep in mind, if you generate a key, operation is not blinded.
Exponentiation in Miller-Rabin test, squaring, and CRT components
calculation (3x modular multiplicative inverse) is not blinded too.  SPA,
DPA or IPA can be used to extract some informations about generated key.
Therefore it is recommended to generate key only in secure environment, if
key security is important.

OsEID project does not use strong primes for P and Q.  Strong primes can
protect us from faktorization of modulus using Pollard's algorithm, but
strong primes do not protect us against new methods of modulus factorization
for example Lenstra elliptic curve factorization or Number Field Sieve.


_RSA key generation is not resistant to side channels attack_

Please read more about <<RSA_attack_resistance>>, OsEID is hobby card, you
can not expect perfect resistance to all attacks.


ECC security
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Briefly, all implemented curves are not secure enough, more info at
<<SAFECURVES>>.  Apart from this information, implemented elliptic curves
are widely used on the Internet.  If you have any doubts about the safety of
NIST curves, please search internet about rigidity of NIST curves.  Some
information can be found here: <<NIST_RIGGED>>

To prevent SPA, EC calculation is running in constant time (but not perfect
constant time, for example, modular multiplicative inversion run time
depends on input numbers).  OsEID implementation also uses blinding in point
multiplication.  Random 32 bit value is used to blind private key in point
multiplication.  SPA attack is not very effective.  Still DPA/IPA can be
used to extract some of sensitive information from other functions.  It is,
however, much more problematic as the attack on not blinded point
multiplication.



_Card firmware implementation may also have some security bugs.  You have
been warned._

(Do you know about these shortcomings in the world of commercial cards?)

Opensc 0.20
~~~~~~~~~~~

Card is automaticaly detected. No patch is needed. If you need support for
secp256k1, please read about experimental support for secp256k1 below.

Opensc 0.17, 018 and 0.19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Opensc 0.17, 0.18 and 0.19 can detect all features of OsEID except of
support for secp256k1.  To use myeid driver for OsEID card you need to
configure OpenSC package only.  Please insert OsEID ATR into *opensc.conf*
file.

Experimental support for secp256k1

With this patch you can upload secp256k1 key into card. You can generate key
by openssl and upload to card by standart opensc tool:

....
pkcs1515-init --store-private-key key.pem
....

There is no simple way to decide what curve is used (secp256k1/secp256r1) in
card firmware/OpenSC.  Original MyEID card does not support curve OID
specification in key upload/key generate functions.  It is not simple to
design a reasonable method for specifying curve OID, which does not affect
compatibility with newer versions of MyEID card.  For now, filetype 0x23 is
used to mark secp256k1 internal key file.

After uploading secp256k1 key, you need to determine key file path (use
pkcs15-tool -D command).  Then change type of this file.  For this purpose
proprietary APDU can be used.  This proprietary APDU is a special variant of
PUT DATA command, but with CLA code 0x80:

0x80 0xDA 0x00 0x00 0x00


Before use of this APDU, SELECT and VERIFY command must be issued on key
file. (Key file path can be determined by pkcs15-tool -D command)

Please read OsEID-tool script for example usage.

Card can generate secp256k1 key, but this needs more patches in OpenSC
(before key is generated, key file must be created with 0x23 value in tag
0x82).  Unfortunately, there is no curve type information available in this
part of OpenSC (ver 0.16.0) code and there is no simple way to determine
what curve is to be used (secp256k1/prime256v1).

To test key generation, there is a simple way - recompile OpenSC to always
generate 0x23 value in tag 0x82 for EC keys.

Random generator implementation
-------------------------------

Both  implementations (ATmega128  and xmega) use similar and very simple
random number generator.  There is no seed, no hash function, no reseed
function.

Xmega uses 12 bit ADC to measure internal temperature sensor (to internal
band gap reference).  Only bit 0 from ADC conversion is used as entropy
value.

Generator tests by *ent* software from http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/ (This
tests are made with small data blocks, random generator quality is here well
demonstrated - RSA key generation and ECC cryptography uses small data
blocks)

............................................................................
File parsed as the bit stream:
==============================
Entropy = 1.000000 bits per bit.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 83264 bit file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 83264 samples is 0.04, and randomly
would exceed this value 75.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bits is 0.5003 (0.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.155709343 (error 0.45 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000145 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).

File parsed as the byte stream:
===============================
Entropy = 7.981877 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 10408 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 10408 samples is 258.70, and randomly
would exceed this value 50.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4115 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.155709343 (error 0.45 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.001352 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
............................................................................

The result is excellent for such a simple generator.


Unfortunately, similar result is not available on atmega with 10 bit ADC.
There is no temperature sensor.  ADC is set to measure input voltage (to
internal band gap reference).  Only bit 0 from ADC conversion is used as
entropy value.

Result of this RNG is not good.  Random generator is strongly affected by
input voltage characteristics (this depends on card reader, USB host,
cables, external interference etc..).  For example, in some environments
random generated data are significantly biased - arithmetic mean value over
160 or higher, Monte Carlo value for PI below 0.1, Chi square never exceed
0.01 percent, etc...  In some other environment RNG data are relatively good,
but still Chi square is wrong.

To get better result, DES cipher is used on 16 bytes from ADC random data (8
bytes data, 8 bytes key) and resulting 8 bytes from DES cipher xored with
key are used as return value from RNG.

<<<

In next tables results for OsEID token/card and MyEID card can be compared.
(Beware, in this table, result for atmega generator without DES is one of the
good ones /one of the best, but still with very wrong chi square value)

Card simulator
--------------

All card functions can be tested without any hardware.  Card simulation is
then running as one task in OS.  Simulation is attached to pseudoterminal.
This pseudoterminal is then connected to simulated card reader, and this
reader is attached to *pcscd*.  Simulation creates one file *card_mem*,
where it maintains the FLASH and EEPROM memory of card.

For now, this simulator must run with *root privileges*.  *Consider this before
running* this on your computer.  You need *socat* package to run simulation.
This simulation is tested on DEBIAN 9.1 system.

Steps to use:
....
1. Unpack OsEID tarball
2. cd src
3. make -f Makefile.console
4. su / sudo to get root
5. systemctl stop pcscd.socket
6. systemctl stop pcscd.service
7. build/console/run_pcscd.sh
8. switch to another window/console
9. pcsc_scan
....

If card is available, You can use *OsEID-tool* to test functionality of card
(OsEID-tool is in tool directory included in tarball)

....
./OsEID-tool INIT
./OsEID-tool RSA-CREATE-KEYS
./OsEID-tool RSA-UPLOAD-KEYS
pkcs15-tool -D
./OsEID-tool RSA-DECRYPT-TEST
....

*WARNING!* all other readers in system are available to *pcscd* too, please
disconnect all other readers  or remove another cards from reader to
prevent unwanted modification of your real card.



Better (but slower) simulation uses *simulavr*. This allow us to test card
functionality inclusive ASM routines for AVR, measuring speed of procedures
and debugging card function in native AVR instructions. Please read
*targets/simulavr/Readme* from OsEID tarball.

DES and AES implementation
--------------------------

Both ciphers are optimized to minimal flash size.  Of course, the code is
written in assembler, but C version is available to.  Both ciphers are
optimized to run on 8 bit AVR microcontroller.  Xmega microcontroller
already contains DES instruction, but due absence of this instruction in
atmega, both microcontrollers uses same code (without special DES
instructions).  Xmega contains accelerated engine for 128 bit AES.  This is
not used for the same reason - atmega does not contain this accelerator. 
Limiting AES to 128 bit is another reason to do not use xmega accelerator.

Both ciphers are designed to run in constant time (time does not depend on
message or key bits).  Timing attack is protected, but differential power
attack is not protected.  (similar problem is in XMEGA accelerated engine:
https://www.cryptolux.org/images/7/7b/Xmegarump.pdf,
https://wiki.newae.com/Tutorial_A6_Replication_of_Ilya_Kizhvatov%27s_XMEGA%C2%AE_Attack
or location dependent EM leakage, please search internet for this keywords).


DES
~~~

Code is modified, does not use standard permutations as described by DES
original (NIST) description.

Message expansion (E), Permuted choice 1 (PC-1) and Permuted choice 2 (PC-2)
are merged into one 56 bit long message expansion.  This expanded message is
directly XORed by plain key.  S-box addresses are selected from result of
XOR operation by table.  S-boxes are merged to one table (256 bytes).

Initial and inverse initial permutation is done by procedures.  Key
expansion is in procedure too.  Only the permutation (P) is unchanged.

Code is really small, 800 bytes for DES or 828 bytes if 3DES is needed.
Speed about 50 000 clock cycles for DES decipher or encipher.

More informations can be found in C and ASM sources.

AES
~~~

AES supports key sizes 128/192/256 bits.  AES code is extra small, below 600
bytes.  S-BOX is calculated into RAM.  About 800 bytes of RAM is needed (for
S-box, inverse S-box and expanded key).  Code is compact, does not use
context and therefore the S-box must be calculated repeatedly for every run
of AES.  Speed is sufficient, about 40 000 clock cycles for one AES encipher
or decipher with 256 bit key.
